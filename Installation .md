Installation-guide

It must be installed:

 - Node.js  -> https://nodejs.org/en/
 - MongoDB -> https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Setup:

 - Download/pull project from github.
 - npm install ( install packeges and dependencies )
 - in terminal write: nodemon app.js 
 
 And we can already use the program, I recommend using postman so that we can follow the process more easily
